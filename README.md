Aspiring IT professional focused on networking, virtualization, and cloud technologies.

Current Project: Home Lab Server

I am building a home lab to gain hands-on experience with: Virtualization (Proxmox), Windows & Linux server environments, Networking configuration and segmentation, Active Directory fundamentals, Troubleshooting and system administration

This lab is designed to simulate real-world IT environments and strengthen practical skills alongside CompTIA A+ and Network+ studies and eventually Security+

Goals:

Develop job-ready technical skills

Document real configuration steps

Build a portfolio of hands-on projects

Prepare for entry-level IT and cloud roles

Tech Stack (Initial Setup. This will grow):

HP EliteDesk

Netgear Switch

Virtual Machines

Windows / Linux environments
